Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis


Learning goals
Develop strong asymptotic analysis and proof skills
Master design paradigms such as divide and conquer greedy and dynamic programming
Gain comfort with advanced data structures and amortized analysis
Reason about randomness approximation and complexity
Write reference implementations and test them

How to study
Follow modules in order
For each module read the note solve the core problems then complete the lab
Commit your solutions with short messages

Repository map
syllabus holds weekly modules
notes holds extra explanations beyond modules
labs holds code in Python and C plus plus
solutions holds your written solutions
assets holds diagrams you draw from the flowchart step lists
