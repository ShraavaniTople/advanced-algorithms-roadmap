Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis

This repository is a complete self study path with original notes worked problems and code labs. Use the syllabus folder to navigate. The Project view in GitHub can track your study with columns To Do In Progress Review Done.

Learning goals
Develop strong asymptotic analysis and proof skills
Master design paradigms such as divide and conquer greedy and dynamic programming
Gain comfort with advanced data structures and amortized analysis
Reason about randomness approximation and complexity
Write reference implementations and test them

How to study
Follow modules in order
For each module read the note solve the core problems then complete the lab
Commit your solutions with short messages
