Title
Introduction

Concept summary
This module sets up tools habits and expectations. You will confirm your environment for Python and C plus plus learn how to run tests and practice writing clear commit messages. You will also see how each later module follows the same pattern note worked example flowchart step list coding lab and practice set.

Study goals
Know how to run Python scripts and compile C plus plus programs on your Mac
Know how to add commit and push changes to the remote repository
Understand how to use the module template in this syllabus

Worked example
Problem
Write and run a short program in Python that prints the inversion count of a small array and a short program in C plus plus that prints a simple value. Confirm outputs and record the run commands so you can repeat them later.

Solution outline
Use the provided labs to run a simple Python script and a simple C plus plus program. Compare expected output with your screen. If anything fails record the message and fix the missing tool.

Flowchart step list for any new lab you add
Start
Pull latest changes from the repository
Open the lab file in your editor
Read the docstring or header comment for inputs and outputs
Run or compile and run the program
Compare output with the expected result and write down any difference
If different inspect the logic print intermediate values and rerun
Commit changes with a short message and push
End

Coding lab
Environment check for Python and C plus plus

Practice set
One write a short Python script that prints your name and the current date
Two write a short C plus plus program that reads three integers and prints their sum
Three create a new file in the notes folder where you summarize what tools are installed on your machine
Four write a list of three habits that will make this study plan effective for you
Five add one improvement you want to make to the repository layout and note why

Reflection
What part of the toolchain felt slow or confusing
What one change would make your daily workflow smoother
